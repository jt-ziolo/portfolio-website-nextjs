### Cloud Deployment and Hosting Expertise

As an AWS-certified developer, I offer:

- Knowledge of various cloud hosting solutions, including virtual machines, containers (Docker), and serverless architectures
- Guidance on selecting the most cost-efficient hosting solution for your specific needs
- Secure and scalable build and deployment solutions using the AWS Cloud

I have deployed various types of web applications to the AWS Cloud using the Terraform and Serverless Stack Toolkit (SST) Infrastructure as Code (IaC) frameworks. Beyond AWS, I have some experience with other cloud platforms such as Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform, and can provide assistance on related projects.
