### React/Next.js Development Skills

As an expert in Next.js, the leading full-stack React framework, I deliver modern, efficient, and scalable web solutions. **This website was built using Next.js**; you can find other examples of my work in the [Projects](/#projects) section.

I have a critical eye for good UI/UX design, and follow design principles to achieve professional and appealing web designs. I use Figma to iterate on designs with my clients. My sites are built to work well for a variety of different devices and browsers. You can find more examples of designs I've created on [my Dribbble page](https://dribbble.com/jt-ziolo).
